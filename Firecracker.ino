    Firecracker

    Rules:
    If button pressed...
    explode with firecracker like flashing of lights that spreads to neighboring tiles
        
    if receive spark, explode like firecracker and  remember who I received spark from
    
    after an initial ignition time, pick one of my other neighbors to send the spark to.
    we will not send a spark back to the same place we got it from. 
    if no suitable neighbors available, firecracker is extinguished.
